# TFClient
## Basic Info
- branch: develop

### EventEmitter
import { EventEmitter } from 'eventemitter3';
- EventEmitter is a class that provides a simple interface for emitting and listening to events. It is a part of the eventemitter3 package, which is a faster and more memory-efficient implementation of the EventEmitter class.

### A TF Client that listens to TFs from tf2_web_republisher.
### Understand export default class TFClient extends EventEmitter {}
The statement export default class TFClient extends EventEmitter {} in JavaScript is a declaration and export of a class, making use of ES6 class and module syntax. Here's a breakdown of each component of the statement:

1. export default
export: This keyword is used to expose members (like variables, functions, classes) defined in one module so that they can be imported and used in other modules.
default: This keyword specifies that the class being exported should be the default export of the module. When a module is imported without curly braces ({}) and without specifying a particular name, the default export is what will be imported.
2. class TFClient
class: This introduces a class declaration. A class in JavaScript is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function, you use class.
TFClient: This is the name of the class. In this context, TFClient likely represents a client for handling transformations, often used in applications dealing with robotics or simulations where spatial transformations need to be managed and communicated.
3. extends EventEmitter
extends: This keyword is used to create a class as a child of another class. It sets up the inheritance chain, so the new class inherits methods and properties from the parent class.
EventEmitter: As mentioned before, EventEmitter is a class used for handling events. By extending EventEmitter, TFClient inherits its capabilities, which means instances of TFClient can emit events and have other parts of the application listen to those events.
4. {} (class body)
{}: These braces enclose the body of the class. Inside the braces, you can define properties, constructors, and methods that belong to the class. In your given example, the class body is empty, which means no additional properties or methods are defined within the TFClient class in the snippet you provided. However, it's possible that the actual class body is defined elsewhere or that this is just a simplified excerpt.
Usage and Implications
The TFClient class, by extending EventEmitter, gains the ability to work with event-driven programming paradigms within its functionality. This could be particularly useful in a scenario where TFClient manages or reacts to changes in transformation data in real-time systems, such as robotics, and needs to notify other parts of the system about these changes through events.

In practice, you could create an instance of TFClient like this:

```javascript
import TFClient from './TFClient.js';  // Assuming the file is named TFClient.js

const tfClient = new TFClient();
tfClient.on('update', () => {
    console.log('Transformation data updated');
});

// Somewhere in TFClient, it might emit an 'update' event.
tfClient.emit('update');
```

Here, tfClient will use inherited methods from EventEmitter, such as on to listen to an event and emit to trigger an event, showcasing the event-driven capabilities inherited from EventEmitter.
