# Understanding the package.json file
The package.json file is the heart of a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, such as the project name, version, and dependencies. The package.json file is used by npm to manage the project's dependencies and scripts.

## files
files
  "files": [
    "dist"
  ],

  It will generate the dist folder and include it in the package when you publish it to npm. 
## main
"main": "./dist/RosLib.umd.cjs",
    The main field specifies the entry point of the package. When someone imports your package, this is the file that will be loaded first.

## exports
"exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/RosLib.umd.js",
      "require": "./dist/RosLib.umd.cjs"
    }
  },
  "types": "modules"
   here, we are specifying the entry points for the package using the exports field. The import field specifies the entry point for ES modules, while the require field specifies the entry point for CommonJS modules. The types field specifies that the package uses ES modules.

## ES modules
Es modules are the new standard for JavaScript modules. They allow you to import and export modules using the import and export keywords. To use ES modules in your package, you need to specify the "type" field in your package.json file.

## CommonJs modules
CommonJS modules are the traditional way of importing and exporting modules in Node.js. To use CommonJS modules in your package, you need to specify the "type" field in your package.json file.

## types

## chai
"chai": "^4.3.4",
    The chai package is a popular assertion library for testing JavaScript code. It provides a set of functions that make it easy to write tests for your code.

## grunt
"grunt": "^1.4.1",
    The grunt package is a task runner for JavaScript projects. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying your code.

## grunt-browserify
"grunt-browserify": "^5.3.0",
    The grunt-browserify package is a plugin for the grunt task runner that allows you to bundle your JavaScript code using the browserify module bundler.
    browserify is a tool that allows you to write Node.js-style modules that can be used in the browser.

## eslint
"eslint": "^7.32.0",
    The eslint package is a popular JavaScript linter that helps you find and fix problems in your code. It enforces coding standards and best practices, making your code more readable and maintainable.

## typescript
"typescript": "^4.4.4",
    The typescript package is a popular programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It adds static typing to JavaScript, making it easier to catch errors and write more maintainable code.

## vite
"vite": "^2.6.4",
    The vite package is a modern build tool for JavaScript projects. It provides fast and efficient builds, hot module replacement, and a zero-config setup.

## vite vs grunt
1. Vite is a modern build tool that provides fast and efficient builds, hot module replacement, and a zero-config setup. Grunt is a task runner that allows you to automate repetitive tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying your code.


## scripts
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "doc": "jsdoc -r -c jsdoc_conf.json -d ./doc .",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "vitest",
    "prepublishOnly": "npm run test",
    "prepare": "npm run build"
  },
    The scripts field in the package.json file allows you to define custom scripts that can be run using npm. For example, you can define a build script that runs the vite build command, a doc script that generates documentation using jsdoc, a lint script that runs eslint, and a test script that runs vitest. You can also define lifecycle scripts, such as prepublishOnly and prepare, that run before and after publishing the package to npm.

## tsfile
- What is tsfile?
  - tsfile is a file that contains TypeScript code. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. tsfile is used to write TypeScript code that can be compiled to JavaScript.
