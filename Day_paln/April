# Plan in April
## 4.17
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning overview
- [ ] two papers about BTs
- [ ] Transformer with BTs
### Thinking
#### BTs algorithms
- is really necessary to use BTs with exploring each node, It seems it use nonexperienced nodes to explore the tree. which is non efficient.
- How to describe the language of rules and also the experience of the rules.
- each BT has its own rules. how to create a general BTs, which can suites most models?
#### Define more about the tasks
- let robot pick up the object from table to the box in B point
- translate the text in newspaper and display it in the screen, last write the comment to the article.
- LLMs is different to automaticaly generate the BTs, LLMs just follow or guess with high possiblility, but BTs is more like a tree to explore the rules.
### how to create a BTs with help of LLMs
- LLMs can generate the rules, and BTs can explore the rules.

- A rule is actually an algorithm, which can be used to generate the BTs.
- alpha go tech could help:
- chatgpt can create a BT, how?
